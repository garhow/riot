# Riot
Riot is a free multiplayer first-person shooter based on [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). The game features many fundamental game mechanics inspired by games such as [Counter-Strike](https://counter-strike.net/) or [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/). 

The game is in *very* early stages of development and bug reports are highly appreciated!
